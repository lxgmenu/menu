                    an
                    experience you know and enjoy every second of its comforting familiarity. Don’t worry about what to
                    wear, the league will pick you out the best damn dress at the thirst shop they end up in! From there
                    you’ll enjoy a magical evening out on the town getting to know the locals in your sweet new dress.
                    Don’t
                    think you can handle all the fun? Don’t worry if you get too tuckered out the league will likely
                    agree
                    to let you change into something more fabulous at some point, just be sure not to pester them about
                    when
                    that will be or you might not like the answer. This item is a stable and never leaves our menu,

                <p>Easy there fuzzy little man peach, have you ever drunk Bailey’s from a shoe? Make an assessment. Do
                    you
                    like Bailey’s? Mmmm creamy so creamy beige. Delicious. Spend the weekend like you’re at Old Gregg’s
                    place, he has all things that are good, and drink nothing but Bailey’s all weekend. You’ll have
                    everything you need, you’ll have Bailey’s, creamy, and everything you need. You can do water colors
                    like
                    one where it's as close as you can get to Bailey’s without your eyes getting wet. You’ll be able to
                    play
                    your love games with the whole LXG all weekend and show us your downstairs mixup. You’ll be
                    permitted a
                    few bottles of water during the weekend, but to be clear you will drink virtually exclusively
                    Bailey’s

                    in
                    the Men’s Department (or sneak a peek at the sensual lingerie next door, you sly dog). Plan a

                    be
                    sending hourly selfies to us from inside the store. We’ll probably even come check on you at some

                    Don’t get kicked out though, or you’ll have to pick something else to complete. This could be heaven

                    Once the league approves, step into the shoes of your hero and get after it! Focus and do the robot

                    to solicit it from strangers at a crowded intersection. This wonderful choice will have you raising
                    money for the LXG in just such a way. The league will help you choose a cause, perhaps your raising
                    money from fantasy football lessons because you suck, perhaps its money to increase micro-penis
                    awareness, or maybe its to fight prejudice because love sees no color, gender, or age. You’ll be at
                    the
                    intersection until you raise X dollars for the cause or spend X hours trying. All proceeds will go
                    toward draft day debauchery. Probably illegal, that’s on you baby (a yeah).</p>
